I've been playing Mindustry since the days of level progression before the planet set-up (awesome update btw) and I have thought about this for a while. My suggestion is more automation with the units, specifically on erekir. My favorate thing about mindustry is automization. I can move materials myself, but i would rather build automize the logistics with conveyors. What I'm saying is I don't like having to manually command all the units that can't build, its a manual aspect of a game about automation. I miss the old versions where units automatically targeted and sought enemy units, and the command center or whatever it was called. The game feels more stressful without these.
